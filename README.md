3.- The strucute of this document is composed first for <html op=news> making the "start" of the document.
The n, it contains a <head> where it contains the "metadata" of the element, that is, information that is not shown but that is used like styles, colors, character type, etc... In this case it gives names, besides icons. Then there is <body>, where it contains the information "centered" <center>, it has a table "<table>" wich has a "hnmain" id. Within this table <tbody> where each <tr> gives a new "section" to the table, and each <td> is the data if that section. Obviously when a tag ends it ends with the <\nametag>

4.-In the Sources window you can see the resources to be used by the page, these can be the icons, images.
In this case we can see the gifs that are used, but apart you have a "news.css", which contains the style and the structure to use for the tags, we know that we are using this file by the <html op=news>. Last we have a "hn.js" file that are the functions used by the page.
